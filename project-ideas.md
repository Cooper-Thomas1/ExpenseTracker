Project Ideas Provided:
- An exercise tracking application, where users track their exercise habits, can view stats about their habits, and share information about their achievements with their friends on the system.
- A statistical analysis tool, allowing users to upload certain types of datasets (e.g. timeseries, tabular data), and then run standard statistical analysis algorithms (e.g. regression, clustering, outlier detection) on them, and share their findings and datasets with their colleagues.
- A course-selector tool, allowing users to upload details (e.g. times, duration, credit hours) of courses they are interested in taking, and then run scheduling algorithms to generate a plausible selection of units, and allowing users to share suggested schedules with their classmates.
- A tournament management system, where users can input results of sports/board games tournaments, see player stats, and then share results with other users.
- An infectious disease monitoring system where users can upload datasets of infections, and the application will plot them on a map and you can share areas with high outbreaks to other users.
- A news sentiment analysis tool, allowing users to upload or input news content, and then analyse the text using NLP algorithms (e.g., sentiment scoring) to determine overall sentiment, and share the analysed data with their colleagues.
